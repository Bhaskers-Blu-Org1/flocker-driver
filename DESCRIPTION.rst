IBM Storage Plugin for Flocker
======================

This is the IBM plugin/driver for the [Flocker](https://clusterhq.com/) project which delivers Fast, local, persistent storage for Docker containers, multi-host container management, database migrations, and flexible shared storage (SAN, NAS or block) for Docker.

## Description
Flocker helps orchestrate and provision storage for your clustered docker container microservice applications. The typical use cases include:
- Seamless running of stateful microservices.
   - Running databases in containers
      - MongoDB, Cassandra, Postgres, MySQL, and more!
- Orchestrating and scheduling container applications across a cluster with optional provisioning of flexible shared storage.
- Use it with [Docker Native Extensions](https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker-docker-plugin)
